PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE
Program was created to do different sorts of matrix manipulation. In both c++ and c

FILES
matrix.cpp, matrix.h, myProgram.cpp, and makefile is all for the c++ version

matrix2.c, matrix2.h, myProgram2.c is all for the c version

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

TESTING METHODOLOGY
I tested the code but doing version outputs and using a calculator to make sure the work was correct. C++ version works well however I was not able to finish the C version

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The C++ version is pretty much done. The C version was only missing two parts. The transpose and matrix multiplication.
